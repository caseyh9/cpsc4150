HOW TO RUN THE APP:
Since you are viewing this readme file, weâ€™ll assumer you have already unzipped the project folder.
Next, open the android project in android studio.
Click the hammer icon at the top of the screen to build the project.
Next, in the drop-down menu near the hammer icon, select the Pixel 2 emulator.
Then click the play icon in android studio to launch a Pixel 2 emulator.
Once the emulator has started, click on the Hird_HW1 app and use the app.

DESIGN CHOICES:
The color scheme used is mainly blue since blue is a non-distracting background color.
The combination of light blue, dark blue, and white text were chosen using a color picker on
https://coolors.co/. The light blue was used for the app background since it is softer and easier
on the eyes, while the dark blue was used as background for text boxes since it provides a greater
contrast with the white text, allowing for easier readability.
Other design choices include the use of the sans-serif font family, chosen since it is common
and widely-accepted, and the decision to use all-caps in the button text, chosen since this is a
common technique used to distinguish buttons from other text.
